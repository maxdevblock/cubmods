Introduction
============

The class of CUB (Combination of Uniform and Binomial) models, proposed by Professor Domenico Piccolo in 
2003 :cite:p:`piccolo2003moments` within the cotext of rating and preference data analysis, hypothesizes that 
the ordinal responses provided by the raters are not the simple result of a reasoned choice, but rather the
complex combination of a multitude of factors, both internal and external :cite:p:`piccolo2019class`.  

Simplifying, two main components can be distinguished:
*feeling* and *uncertainty*.  

The primary component of feeling
is due to sufficient awareness and understanding of the topic based on
knowledge and experience :cite:p:`piccolo2019class`.  
The secondary component of uncertainty is instead generated by an *intrinsic fuzziness*, due to 
various circumstances: limited knowledge, lack of interest, timing of the survey, method of 
administration, boredom, etc. :cite:p:`piccolo2019class`. 

The simplest way to consider these 
two aspects is a distribution resulting from a
mixture of a shifted Binomial component for the first and Uniform Discrete for the
second :cite:p:`piccolo2019class` which takes the form of the CUB family models, subsequently 
extended to consider further factors such as the overdispersion of
Binomial component, the effect of shelter choice, etc. :cite:p:`piccolo2019class`.

This package is the first implementation of CUB class models in Python and is mainly based upon 
the work of Domenico Piccolo and Rosaria Simone, and the ``CUB`` package in R :cite:p:`iannario2022package`.

It has been implemented by Massimo Pierini as a Bachelor's thesis :cite:p:`mythesis`.

Motivation
**********

Currently the class of CUB models has been implemented in statistical and econometric programming languages 
such as R :cite:p:`iannario2022package`, Stata :cite:p:`cerulli2021stata`, 
Gretl :cite:p:`simone2019cub,piccolo2019class` 
and GAUSS :cite:p:`piccolo2006observed`.  However, given the recent increase in the development 
of the Python programming language also in the statistical field :cite:p:`pittard2020essential`, 
their implementation in
this environment could be useful to the scientific community.

Notes
*****

To simplify the notation, the complete matrix of the covariates will be occasionally indicated by :math:`\pmb T` and the column vector of model's parameters by :math:`\pmb\theta`.
